This is basically a simulatioon of the early universe:

* We start with neutrons and protons.
* We move forward by picking up two random atoms and colliding them to see whether they would fuse or not (looking at their energy barriers, and the stability of the result).
* We stop of no reactions have taken place for a very long time.
* At the moment, the only way one can see the current percentages is by pressing `CTRL+C`. This will pause the simulation, and allow the user to see the following parameters:
	* Elements/isotopes created
	* Current element/isotope distribution
	* Number of turns since last reaction took place
* The simulation can also be stopped at any time by pressing `CTRL+C`.

TODO: This isn't really very user-friendly, and it's a little non-intuitive.
